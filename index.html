                <h2>The Data</h2>
                <p>The data shown is sourced from the Australian Goverment. It contains details on commercial air travel in 2017 
                    across the nation.<br>
                    Using this data we can see where people typically fly. Additionally, we can also see how Australia's more rural locations 
                    are served.<br><br>
                    The data (and therefore the visualisation) does not distinguish directional element in routes, with the data shown 
                    representing travel both ways.<br><br>
                    Cities are split into three categories. Capital's, Metro, and Regional.<br>
                    Metro locations are cities with a population larger than 50,000 without being the state capital.<br>
                </p>

                <h2>Connections between Locations</h2>

                <div id="figure_1"></div>
                <p>
                    As expected flights are concentrated on the east coast with Perth being a western hub for regional connections.<br>
                    Interestingly there are no flights from Perth to Alice Springs, or Darwin to Broome. Furthermore the only connection to Uluru is Sydney.

                <h2>Volume between States</h2>
                <p>See which interstate trips are the most popular. Volume is measured in people transported.</p>
                <div id="figure_2"></div>
                <p>Given that Sydney and Melbourne are Australia's biggest cities the number of connections between their two states is very high.<br><br>
                It is also of no suprise that the state with the most internal traffic is Queensland, likely due to it containing several Metropolitan locations.</p>

                <p>The number of flights arriving at and departing from the busiest airports.</p>
                <div id="figure_3"></div>
                <p>It is of no suprise that the airports with the most connections and largest populations have the largest number of flights. 
                    Additionally, these airports would also have more international connections.<br><br>
                    With 8/10 of the locations on the east coast of the country it is clear where most of Australia's population resides.

                <h2>Plane size vs Distance</h2>
                <p>We can investigate how the size of planes used increases with the length of the flight.</p>
                <div id="figure_4"></div>
                <p>
                    It is clear that flights to regional cities are usually short and on small flights. Likely due to limited demand.<br><br>
                    However, it can be seen that once a flight of distance 1000km is reached place size typically remains the same 
                    except for a few key connections.<br>
                    (For Reference: Brisbane - Canberra is ~950km)

                <h2>Flight Capacity Levels</h2>
                <p>The stacked barcode chart shows the average capacity of each route by their route type.</p>
                <div id="figure_5"></div>
                <p>It can clearly be seen that most flights generally fly with 20% of seats empty. As expected regional flights are often less full.<br>
                An outlier can also be identified, the Melbourne to Hamilton Island (Resort Holiday Destination) has an average capacity of 18%.</p>
